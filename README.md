Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project is related to basketball players and includes various attributes such as player names, team names, positions, ages, heights, weights, colleges, and salaries. The dataset is loaded from a Google Sheets URL and contains 458 rows and 9 columns.

Preprocessing Steps
Loading the Dataset: The dataset is loaded from a Google Sheets URL using the pandas library.

Column Display: The columns of the dataset are displayed to check the column names.

Height Correction: The "Height" column is corrected by replacing it with random values between 150 and 180.

Data Verification: The updated "Height" column is checked to ensure it has been updated correctly.

Analysis Tasks
Team Distribution: The distribution of employees across each team is determined, and the percentage split relative to the total number of employees is calculated.

Visualization for Team Distribution: A bar plot is created to visualize the distribution of employees across teams using seaborn.

Graphical Representations
Team Distribution Bar Plot: A bar plot is generated to show the distribution of employees across different teams. This helps in understanding the composition of players in each team.

Insights Gained
Team Composition: The analysis reveals the distribution of players across various teams, highlighting which teams have the most and least number of players.

Height Correction: The preprocessing step ensures that the "Height" column contains realistic values, which is crucial for accurate analysis.

Additional Information
Libraries Used: The project utilizes several Python libraries, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn, for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

Dataset Source: The dataset is sourced from a Google Sheets URL, making it easily accessible and modifiable.

Preprocessing Importance: Correcting the "Height" column with random values ensures that the dataset is more realistic and suitable for analysis.

Visualization: The use of graphical representations like bar plots helps in quickly understanding the distribution and composition of the dataset.

This project provides a comprehensive approach to analyzing a basketball players dataset, from preprocessing to visualization, offering valuable insights into team compositions and player attributes.
